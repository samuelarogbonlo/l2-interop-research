# L2 Interoperability Research

**Advancing Intent-Based Cross-Chain Execution for Ethereum Layer 2s**

## Overview

This research project explores intent-based interoperability solutions for Ethereum Layer 2 networks, focusing on reducing user friction while maintaining security and decentralization. The work contributes to ERC-7683 standard development and investigates shared sequencing architectures.

## Research Goals

### Primary Objectives
- **Standardize intent-based execution** across L2 networks
- **Reduce cross-chain friction** for end users
- **Improve price discovery** across fragmented liquidity
- **Advance ERC-7683 implementation** and ecosystem adoption

### Research Questions
1. How can intent-based execution eliminate bridge dependencies?
2. What are the security implications of shared sequencing models?
3. How do we optimize cross-chain price discovery mechanisms?
4. What standards are needed for L2 interoperability at scale?

## Problem Statement

Ethereum's Layer 2 ecosystem has grown to 55+ networks with $50B+ locked across isolated silos. Users face:

- **Complex UX**: Multiple wallets, wrapped tokens, bridge confusion
- **Security risks**: $2.5B+ lost to bridge hacks since 2020  
- **Inefficient execution**: Suboptimal prices due to liquidity fragmentation
- **Developer friction**: Building separately for each L2

## Research Approach

### 1. Intent-Based Architecture
Investigating execution models where users express desired outcomes rather than specific transactions:

```
Traditional: "Bridge 1000 USDC to Optimism, then swap for ETH"
Intent-Based: "Exchange 1000 USDC for ETH at best price"
```

### 2. ERC-7683 Standard Implementation
Contributing to the CrossChainOrder standard for intent-based execution:
- Order specification and settlement protocols
- Filler network coordination
- Security and verification mechanisms

### 3. Shared Sequencing Research
Exploring unified ordering mechanisms across L2s:
- Cross-chain MEV mitigation
- Atomic execution guarantees  
- Decentralized sequencer coordination
