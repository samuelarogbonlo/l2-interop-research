# Security Threat Model for Intent-Based Cross-Chain Execution

## Abstract

This document presents a comprehensive threat model for intent-based cross-chain execution systems, analyzing potential attack vectors, trust assumptions, and mitigation strategies from an academic research perspective.

## Threat Landscape

### Attack Surface Analysis

#### 1. Intent Specification Attacks
- **Ambiguous Intent Exploitation**: Attackers exploit unclear intent specifications
- **Intent Spoofing**: Malicious actors submit fraudulent intents
- **Parameter Manipulation**: Invalid or extreme parameter values
- **Deadline Manipulation**: Time-based attacks on intent execution

#### 2. Cross-Chain Execution Attacks
- **Front-Running**: Fillers observe and front-run intent execution
- **Sandwich Attacks**: MEV extraction through intent manipulation
- **Failed Settlement**: Incomplete cross-chain execution scenarios
- **Replay Attacks**: Reusing intent signatures across chains

#### 3. Economic Attacks
- **Filler Collusion**: Coordinated manipulation of execution markets
- **Price Oracle Manipulation**: Exploiting price feed dependencies
- **Liquidity Fragmentation**: Artificial scarcity creation
- **Fee Market Manipulation**: Gaming gas price mechanisms

### Trust Model Analysis

#### Trust Assumptions
1. **Filler Rationality**: Economic incentives drive honest behavior
2. **Bridge Security**: Underlying cross-chain infrastructure reliability
3. **Smart Contract Correctness**: Execution logic vulnerability-free
4. **Oracle Accuracy**: Price and state information correctness

#### Trust Minimization Strategies
- **Cryptographic Verification**: Reduce reliance on trusted parties
- **Economic Bonding**: Stake-based security mechanisms
- **Formal Verification**: Mathematical correctness proofs
- **Decentralized Architecture**: Eliminate single points of failure

## Attack Vector Classification

### High Severity Threats

#### Cross-Chain MEV Extraction
**Description**: Sophisticated MEV extraction across multiple chains
**Impact**: User value extraction, market inefficiency
**Likelihood**: High (profitable for sophisticated actors)
**Mitigation Research**: 
- Batch execution mechanisms
- Commit-reveal schemes
- Fair ordering protocols

#### Settlement Verification Failures
**Description**: False positive settlement confirmations
**Impact**: Loss of user funds, system credibility damage
**Likelihood**: Medium (complex verification logic)
**Mitigation Research**:
- Multi-stage verification protocols
- Economic penalties for false attestations
- Dispute resolution mechanisms

### Medium Severity Threats

#### Filler Market Manipulation
**Description**: Coordinated filler behavior to extract value
**Impact**: Suboptimal execution, increased costs
**Likelihood**: Medium (requires coordination)
**Mitigation Research**:
- Auction mechanism design
- Anti-collusion protocols
- Randomized filler selection

#### Oracle Dependency Attacks
**Description**: Manipulation of external price feeds
**Impact**: Incorrect execution, financial losses
**Likelihood**: Low (requires significant resources)
**Mitigation Research**:
- Decentralized oracle networks
- Multiple oracle validation
- Time-weighted average pricing

### Low Severity Threats

#### Intent Specification Ambiguity
**Description**: Unclear intent leading to unexpected execution
**Impact**: User confusion, suboptimal outcomes
**Likelihood**: High (user error prone)
**Mitigation Research**:
- Formal intent specification languages
- Intent validation frameworks
- User interface design research

## Formal Security Model

### Security Properties

#### Safety Properties
1. **Intent Integrity**: Execution matches user intent specification
2. **Settlement Finality**: Cross-chain transactions reach finality
3. **Value Preservation**: No unexpected value loss during execution
4. **Access Control**: Only authorized parties can execute intents

#### Liveness Properties
1. **Execution Completeness**: Valid intents eventually execute
2. **Deadline Compliance**: Execution respects temporal constraints
3. **Fault Tolerance**: System continues operating under partial failures
4. **Recovery Capability**: Failed executions can be resolved

## Research Methodology

- Historical bridge attack analysis
- MEV extraction pattern studies
- User behavior modeling

1. How can we achieve sub-second cross-chain finality guarantees?
2. What are optimal economic security parameters for filler bonding?
3. How do we balance decentralization with execution efficiency?
4. What formal verification techniques apply to cross-chain protocols?

### Economic Research
1. What auction mechanisms optimize for user welfare in intent execution?
2. How do we prevent centralization in filler markets?
3. What are sustainable economic models for cross-chain infrastructure?
4. How do we align individual and collective incentives?

### User Experience Research
