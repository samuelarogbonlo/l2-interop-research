# Cross-Chain Protocol Literature Survey

## Overview

Comprehensive survey of existing cross-chain protocols, bridge architectures, and interoperability solutions to inform intent-based execution research.

## Bridge Architectures

### Lock-and-Mint Bridges
- **Multichain (Anyswap)**: $1.2B+ hacked due to centralized key management
- **Wormhole**: $320M exploit, guardian signature vulnerability
- **Ronin Bridge**: $625M hack, compromised validator keys

**Key Insight**: Centralized custody creates single points of failure

### Liquidity Network Bridges
- **Hop Protocol**: AMM-based cross-chain transfers
- **Across Protocol**: Optimistic liquidity provision
- **Stargate (LayerZero)**: Unified liquidity pools

**Trade-offs**: Better UX but capital efficiency challenges

### Native Verification Bridges
- **IBC (Cosmos)**: Light client verification
- **Polkadot XCMP**: Shared security model
- **Rainbow Bridge (NEAR)**: Ethereum light client on NEAR

**Advantages**: Trust-minimized but complex implementation

## Intent-Based Systems

### Existing Implementations
- **1inch Fusion**: Intent-based swapping with resolvers
- **UniswapX**: Dutch auction intent settlement
- **CoW Protocol**: Batch intent matching and MEV protection

### ERC-7683 Standard
- **Specification**: CrossChainOrder interface for intent settlement
- **Current Status**: Draft proposal, seeking implementation feedback
- **Gap Analysis**: Missing standardized intent types and settlement verification

## Shared Sequencing Research

### Theoretical Frameworks
- **Espresso Systems**: Decentralized sequencing with ZK proofs
- **Astria**: Shared sequencer for rollup coordination
- **Polygon AggLayer**: Unified bridge with pessimistic ZK proofs

### Security Considerations
- **Censorship resistance** in shared sequencing models
- **MEV extraction** and fair ordering mechanisms  
- **Validator incentive alignment** across multiple chains

## Research Gaps

### Technical Challenges
1. **Intent Standardization**: No unified intent specification language
2. **Cross-Chain Price Discovery**: Inefficient liquidity fragmentation
3. **Settlement Verification**: Complex multi-chain proof systems
4. **MEV Mitigation**: Cross-chain MEV extraction mechanisms

### Economic Models
1. **Sequencer Economics**: Revenue sharing in shared models
2. **Liquidity Incentives**: Bootstrapping cross-chain liquidity
3. **Gas Optimization**: Cross-chain transaction fee structures
4. **Decentralization Trade-offs**: Security vs efficiency balance

## Key Findings

### Bridge Security Patterns
- **Centralization risks** dominate current bridge failures
- **Multi-signature schemes** provide moderate security improvements
- **Light client verification** offers strongest security guarantees
- **Economic security** requires significant stake at risk

### Intent-Based Execution Benefits
- **Reduced user complexity** through outcome specification
- **MEV protection** via batch execution and fair ordering
- **Cross-chain optimization** through unified execution planning
- **Composability preservation** across multiple domains

### Shared Sequencing Potential
- **Atomic cross-chain execution** becomes feasible
- **Unified user experience** across multiple L2s
- **Economic efficiency** through coordinated block building
- **Decentralization challenges** require careful design

## Future Research Directions

### Technical Research
1. **Intent Language Design**: Formal specification for cross-chain intents
2. **Optimization Algorithms**: Multi-chain execution path finding
3. **Security Proofs**: Formal verification of settlement protocols
4. **Privacy Preservation**: Zero-knowledge intent execution

### Economic Research
1. **Mechanism Design**: Optimal sequencer selection and rotation
2. **Liquidity Mining**: Cross-chain liquidity bootstrap strategies
3. **Fee Market Design**: Dynamic pricing for cross-chain execution
4. **Governance Models**: Decentralized protocol upgrade mechanisms
